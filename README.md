# Conway's Game of Life

Simple task for implementing Conway's Game of Life

## Rules

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.


## Features

- Customizable grid size.
- Customization of cell visuals for alive and dead cells.
- Functionality to start, pause, and reset the grid.
- Multiple grid creation
- No loss of grids on page refresh
- Show grid only when clicked on name (to save space and easy to use)
- Functionality to edit grid name.
